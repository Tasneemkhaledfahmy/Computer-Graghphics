## About Our Project

### First, we used some examples from VTK.js website to apply the visualizion of different modes.
 Then we build our project by rendering two widgets:
 1. Surface Rendering.
 2. Ray Casting.
 
### Seconed, in the code ,we made swap function which include two functions :one for skull and another for chest linked by two buttons :one for chest and one for skull
### and all of that loaded in a one page!

| We faced some problems in getting the url of data | We solved this problems by getting the json file of the data so got it finally and loaded data successfully|
| We faced problems with dealing with the `@kitware` package and its `source` file | We solved it by changing the local path in the import lines|
| making one pipeline and load data once | controlling of Actor of skull and chest|
